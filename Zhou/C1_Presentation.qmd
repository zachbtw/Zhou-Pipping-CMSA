## Motivation

::: fragment
-   Determining who the likely recipient can be key in making the optimal decision for the defense as well as evaluating the decision-making of a quarterback

    -   Rewarding quarterbacks for finding uncommon but high-value passes
    -   For a defense, determining likely throw target for appropriate positioning
:::

::: fragment
-   Look to build a ranking model which determines the most likely receiver at a frame given throw attempt

## Data Overview {.smaller}

::::::::: columns
::::::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **2025 NFL Big Data Bowl – Weeks 1–9**

::: fragment
-   **Game Data** – Home and Away Team, Final Score, Game Time
:::

::: fragment
-   **Play Data** – Play Description, Game Context, Play Result, Changes in Win Probability
:::

::: fragment
-   **Player Play Data** – Statistics for each player for a play
    -   Route ran by player, Whether the player made a tackle or interception
:::

::: fragment
-   **Tracking Data** - Locations of players and the football at each frame of a play

## Methodology

::: fragment
-   Building a ranking algorithm(e.g. [XGBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf)) to rank the likeliest recipient at a frame
    -   Similar approaches in soccer[^1]
    -   Extracting features from tracking and play-by-play data

::: fragment
-   Potential pre-snap work, predicting the most likely target given the receiver alignments
:::

## Next Steps

::: fragment
-   Extracting features used to build the ranking model
    -   Distance, Relative Speed, Relative Orientation From Nearest Defender
    -   Quarterback Position, If Under Pressure
    -   Number of Defenders between Quarterback and Receiver, Passing Angle
    -   Game Score, Time Remaining
:::

::: fragment
-   Building baseline models to compare with ranking algorithm

## Motivating Questions

::: fragment
- How likely would other QBs make that same decision?
:::

::: fragment
- Can we quantify how reckless or conservative a QB is?
  - Are QBs being too reckless or too conservative in their throws?
:::

::: fragment
- Contextualizing touchdown throws / interceptions
  - Would other QBs make the same decision?
:::

::: fragment
-   Look to build a ranking model which determines the most likely receiver at a frame given throw attempt
:::

## Data Overview {.smaller}

::::::::: columns
::::::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **2025 NFL Big Data Bowl – Weeks 1–9**

::: fragment
-   **Game and Play Data** – Teams, Score, Play Description, Game Context, Play Result, Changes in Win Probability
:::

::: fragment
-   **Player Play Data** – Statistics for each player for a play
    
:::

::: fragment
-   **Tracking Data** - Locations of players and the football at each frame of a play
:::

::: fragment
- Exclusively looking at throwing plays with an obvious target
  - Removing spikes and throwaways

## Methodology

::: fragment
-   Building a ranking algorithm(i.e.  [XGBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf)) to rank the likeliest recipient at a frame - 53.0  $\pm$ 0.6% accuracy
    -   Imputing Features like distance from tracking and event data
    -   Previous Work: Deep Learning Approach[^1], 59.8% accuracy

## Feature Set
-   **Recipient Features** - Distances, Differences in Orientations and Speeds from Top 5 Closest Defenders, Whether the Throw will Result in a First Down, *Space Creation[^2]*, *Receiver Skill*

::: fragment
-   **Quarterback Features** - Distance from Receiver, Movement Vector, *Defensive Pressure*
:::

::: fragment
-   **Game Context** - Win Probability, Quarter, Down and Distance, Score Differential

## Future Steps
::: fragment
- Continuing to build feature set to increase model performance
  - Looking to perform comparably with previous deep learning approach
:::

::: fragment
- Cutting down on Redundant Features and Parameter Tuning
  - Building the simplest model with the strongest predictive power

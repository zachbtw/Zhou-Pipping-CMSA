## Motivating Questions

::: fragment
-   What would other quarterbacks do in this situation?
:::

::: fragment
-   Which quarterbacks deviate from the expected option the most?
    -   Do some quarterbacks find success in this deviation?
    -   Should some quarterbacks throw more typical passes?
:::

::: fragment
-   Look to build a ranking model to determine the most likely throw target

:::

::: fragment
-   **Player Play Data** – Statistics for each player for a play
    -   Route ran by player, Whether the player made a tackle or interception
:::

## Methodology

::: fragment
-   Building a ranking algorithm(i.e. [XGBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf)) using hand-crafted features to rank the likeliest recipient at a frame - 59.9 $\pm$ 0.5% top-1 accuracy
    -   Using a random hyperparameter search and 5-fold cross validation, with folds on matches
    -   Performs significantly stronger than naive random guess(20%) and choosing the player who is farthest from their closest defender(31%)
:::

::: fragment
-   Applying model to contextualize individual QB decisions by comparing them to model-predicted choices

## Potential Optimization Opportunities with More Conventional Passes

:::

## Discussion {.smaller}

::: fragment
-   Able to model the likely target using an XGBoost Ranking Model with strong predictive power
    -   Model can still be made stronger by incorporating newer factors like receiver skill
    -   Can then contextualize throws with comparisons to the likely target
:::

::: fragment
-   Comparing YPA and Completion Percentage of Throws when throwing to the likely receiver vs. other receivers is far from perfect
    -   Since QBs will face different game states, some may be faced with more situations where the likely throw is the only good option
    -   YPA treats interceptions and incompletions the same, potentially overvaluing players who throw risky, interception-prone throws
:::

::: fragment
-   Future work should be done to model yardage and completion percentage for potential receivers to determine the optimal decision
    -   Can use ranking model to determine whether it is common to find this optimal decision
    -   Rewarding players who find strong but hard to see passes
:::

::: fragment
-   Potential use of pre-snap factors(e.g. coverage mismatches) to update target probabilities
